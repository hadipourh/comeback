# Computing the Probability of Boomerang Switch Based on The FBCT Framework

To compute the probability of the 10-round boomerang switch used in our 14-round sandwich distinguisher for WARP, run the following command:

```python
python3 fbct.py
```

[fbct.py](fbct.py) implements the FBCT framework to compute the probability based on equation 2 in our paper.
